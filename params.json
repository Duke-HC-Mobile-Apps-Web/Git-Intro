Come back to this page after you've finished.\r\n\r\nFollow along [here](http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/enough-git-for-learn.mp4), courtesy of Learn, but note these important differences:\r\n\r\n* Instead of going to the first-lab-000 repo, go to the url for this git intro assignment: <https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro>\r\n* Ignore the instruction telling you to use the SSH url, please use the HTTPS one that you'll see in your forked repository\r\n  * To optionally learn more about setting your machine up to use SSH, check out <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>\r\n* The video walks through adding several files to the repo, we'd like you to only add one .txt file.  If you've added others, look at the *git rm* command\r\n  * It should be titled with your name *firstName_lastName.txt* and should include:\r\n    * Your year and major\r\n    * Your favorite programming language/s\r\n* Make sure you follow the instructions for sending a pull request back to this repo, that's the most important part!\r\n\r\n\r\n##Alternate\r\nFor a text and image version of this assignment (instead of a video): https://github.com/learn-co-students/enough-git-for-learn-co-001-prework-web/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\n\r\n##Topics covered\r\n\r\n1.
