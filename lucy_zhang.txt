Lucy Zhang is a professional anime fan and writes for the satire site Anime Maru. When not working on copious amounts of homework, learning different programming languages, or looking at the ceiling of her room inspecting for bugs, she can be found on her laptop perpetually. She does not like the daylight but encounters it tragically on a daily basis. Lucy's goal at Duke is to convert the student population to anime-ism without any scandals and dissent, but realizes that this may only be possible through a totalitarian regime. Which is far too much effort so she simply sits in her dorm watching on her laptop, waiting for the change to spontaneously happen (this is what is called a passive approach).
