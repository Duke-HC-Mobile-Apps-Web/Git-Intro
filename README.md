# Git-Intro
A git intro lesson

##Assignment

Start with this interactive [git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Come back to this page after you've finished.

Follow along [here](http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/enough-git-for-learn.mp4), courtesy of Learn, but note these important differences:

* Instead of going to the first-lab-000 repo, go to the url for this git intro assignment: <https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro>
* Ignore the instruction telling you to use the SSH url, we're going to use the https one: <https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro.git>
  * To optionally learn more about setting your machine up to use SSH, check out <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>
* The video walks through adding several files to the repo, we'd like you to only add one .txt file.  If you've added others, look at the *git rm* command
  * It should be titled with your name *firstName_lastName.txt* and should include:
    * Your year and major
    * Your favorite programming language/s
* Make sure you follow the instructions for sending a pull request back to this repo, that's the most important part!
