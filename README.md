# Git-Intro
A git intro lesson


Follow along here, courtesy of Learn http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/enough-git-for-learn.mp4, but note these important differences:
* Instead of going to the first-lab-000 repo, go to this one! https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro
* Ignore the instruction telling you to use the SSH url, we're going to use the https one: https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro.git
  * To optionally learn more about setting your machine up to use SSH, check out https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
* The video walks through adding several files to the repo, we'd like you to only add one.  If you've added others, look at the git rm command
  * It should be titled with your name firstName_lastName.txt and should include:
    * Your year and major
    * Your favorite programming language/s
* Make sure you send a pull request back to this repo, that's the most important part!
